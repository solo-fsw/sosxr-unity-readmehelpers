## Installation
1. Open the Unity project you want to install this package in.
2. Open the Package Manager window.
3. Click on the `+` button and select `Add package from git URL...`.
4. Paste the URL of this repo into the text field and press `Add`.

## Reasoning
Using these tools you can have a README that's in your Unity Assets folder, but still be shown on Github as the default README. I found this to be a much easier way to keep the README up to date, as it's always in the same place as the rest of the Unity project.

## How to use
### Creating a README
In Unity, go to `SOSXR > Create README.md file in Assets Folder` or Right Mouse in the Project view, `Create > SOSXR > Create README.md file in Assets Folder`. This will create a README.md file in the Assets folder from the template. You can then edit this file to your liking.
The template is called `README_template.md` and can be found in the Resources folder.

### Showing the README on Github as the default README
Go to your Terminal and run the following command to create a symbolic link from the `.github/README.md` to the one you just created in the Assets folder. The symlink makes sure that the actual README.md lives inside the Assets folder, but is still always displayed on Github as the default README.

```bash
  # From your repository root
  mkdir .github
  cd .github
  ln -s ../YOUR_UNITY_PROJECT_NAME/Assets/README.md README.md 
```

> Note that 'YOUR_UNITY_PROJECT_NAME' should be replaced by the current Unity Project name, so that the entire path to the README.md file is correct.
   
### Markdown Viewer
By default Markdown files render as plain text in Unity. The excellent and Open Source [Markdown Viewer](https://github.com/mrstruijk/Markdownviewer) can alleviate this. Follow the instructions on that repo on how to get it into your Unity Project.

### Showing Readme on starting Unity
To show the README as soon as you're starting Unity, the `ReadmeShower.cs` script is in the Editor folder. This script will open the README.md file in the Inspector on opening Unity. It looks for the first file called `README.md` it can find. If you have multiple READMEs throughout your project, the one that's directly in the Asset folder (compared to those in subfolders) will be found.
